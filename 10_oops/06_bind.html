        /*
            The bind() function creates a new bound function. 
            Calling the bound function generally results in the execution of the function it wraps, which is also called the target function. 
            The bound function will store the parameters passed — which include the value of this and the first few arguments — as its internal state. 
            These values are stored in advance, instead of being passed at call time. 
            You can generally see const boundFn = fn.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2) as being equivalent to 
            const boundFn = (...restArgs) => fn.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...restArgs) for the effect when it's called (but not when boundFn is constructed).
        */
       // This means call and bind behave the same during execution, but the construction is different
