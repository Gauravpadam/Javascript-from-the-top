    <!-- Okay brutus, Now we're getting into JS in web
         Let's start with the basic question, What are web pages made of?
            ReactJS? NextJS? Alright, Frameworks I presume?
          
         Next, What do these frameworks use?
         HTML CSS Javascript? Correct?
         
         Now, What is html made up of?
         The f*ck? html?
         Eh, markups I presume? correct, markups like html head body
        
         Now tell me, what are these markups?
         These markups, These tags, are actually objects at the end of the day,
         In the context of DOM, The Document Object Model
        
         It's no big deal, Hawwa banaake rakha hai bas
         DOM is a collection of page objects in a model structure
         No one cares how you make the model, make a tree, make a waterfall, make ponytails idc it's a model just represent it
         It's just a visual representation (usually tree like) of your entire web page
        
         That's it, Cool-->
