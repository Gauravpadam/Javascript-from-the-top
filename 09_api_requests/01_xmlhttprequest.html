<!-- AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) programming is the legacy method of dealing with asynchronous events.
Every operation is treated as a state here; Eliminating the modern need of async and await.
Though this is legacy and not in use, This is powerful enough that react still uses states to this date-->
